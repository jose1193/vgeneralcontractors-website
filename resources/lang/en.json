    "faq_roof_lifespan_answer": "The lifespan of a residential roof depends on factors like material quality, installation expertise, and weather exposure. <strong>Asphalt shingles typically last 15-25 years</strong>, though high-impact or severe weather can shorten this. We'll help you choose durable materials suited for the Texas climate. If your roof is approaching this age or has weathered storms, a free inspection is highly recommended.",

    "faq_need_new_roof_answer": "Visible damage like missing shingles, leaks, or significant granule loss are clear signs. However, underlying issues aren't always obvious. We provide <strong>FREE, no-obligation onsite inspections</strong> to thoroughly assess your roof's condition. We'll give you an honest, expert opinion on whether repairs are sufficient or if a replacement is necessary for long-term protection.",
    "faq_roof_inspection_question": "What should I expect at a roof inspection?",
    "faq_roof_inspection_answer": "Our <strong>FREE inspection</strong> is comprehensive. A trained professional will carefully examine your shingles (or other roofing material) for wear, damage, and proper installation. We'll inspect flashing, gutters, fascia, vents, and chimneys. We'll also check the attic (if accessible) for signs of leaks or ventilation issues. Afterward, we'll discuss our findings, answer your questions, and explain the recommended next steps, especially if an insurance claim seems warranted.",
    "faq_replacement_time_question": "How long does a roof replacement take?",
    "faq_replacement_time_answer": "Project duration depends on factors like roof size, complexity, and weather. However, our <strong>efficient and experienced crews</strong> work diligently without compromising quality.
