    "faq_trusted_roofing_company_answer": "We pride ourselves on embodying the critical traits of a trusted roofing company. It's crucial to partner with a contractor who is <strong>experienced, knowledgeable, and transparent</strong>. Look for proof of <strong>certifications and insurance</strong>, strong <strong>customer reviews</strong>, clear explanations of <strong>product warranties</strong>, and a willingness to provide a <strong>detailed assessment and action plan</strong>. Choosing the right contractor is key; we invite you to schedule a free inspection to experience our professionalism firsthand.",
    "faq_provide_references_question": "Do you provide references?",
    "faq_provide_references_answer": "Absolutely! We encourage you to visit our <strong>Testimonials page</strong> to read our customer reviews and browse the <strong>Gallery page</strong> to view samples of our professional work completed in <strong>Houston, Dallas, and surrounding areas</strong>.",
    "faq_roof_lifespan_question": "What is the typical lifespan of a roof?",
    "faq_roof_lifespan_answer": "The lifespan of a residential roof depends on factors like material quality, installation expertise, and weather exposure. <strong>Asphalt shingles typically last 15-25 years</strong>, though high-impact or severe weather can shorten this. We'll help you choose durable materials suited for the Texas climate. If your roof is approaching this age or has weathered storms, a free inspection is highly recommended.",
    "faq_roof_types_question": "What kinds of roofs does V-General Contractors install?",
    "faq_roof_types_answer": "Our certified team has extensive experience with various residential and commercial roofing systems, including <strong>pitched roofs, flat roofs, asphalt shingles (like GAF), metal roofing</strong>, and more. We assess your specific structure and needs to recommend the best solution.",
    "faq_insurance_claims_question": "Do you work with insurance claims?",
    "faq_insurance_claims_answer": "Yes, absolutely. Assisting with insurance claims is a core part of our service. We partner with <strong>CERTIFIED public adjusters</strong> to ensure your storm or hail damage claim is thoroughly documented and expertly handled, aiming to <strong>MAXIMIZE your rightful coverage</strong> under your policy. Let us navigate the complexities for you.",
    "faq_need_new_roof_question": "How do I know if I need a new roof?",
    "faq_need_new_roof_answer": "Visible damage like missing shingles, leaks, or significant granule loss are clear signs. However, underlying issues aren't always obvious. We provide <strong>FREE, no-obligation onsite inspections</strong> to thoroughly assess your roof's condition. We'll give you an honest, expert opinion on whether repairs are sufficient or if a replacement is necessary for long-term protection.",
    "faq_roof_inspection_question": "What should I expect at a roof inspection?",
    "faq_roof_inspection_answer": "Our <strong>FREE inspection</strong> is comprehensive. A trained professional will carefully examine your shingles (or other roofing material) for wear, damage, and proper installation. We'll inspect flashing, gutters, fascia, vents, and chimneys. We'll also check the attic (if accessible) for signs of leaks or ventilation issues. Afterward, we'll discuss our findings, answer your questions, and explain the recommended next steps, especially if an insurance claim seems warranted.",
    "faq_replacement_time_question": "How long does a roof replacement take?",
    "faq_replacement_time_answer": "Project duration depends on factors like roof size, complexity, and weather. However, our <strong>efficient and experienced crews</strong> work diligently without compromising quality. For most standard residential roof replacements, we aim to complete the job within <strong>1-2 days</strong>.",
    "faq_stay_in_house_question": "Can I stay in my house while you replace my roof?",
    "faq_stay_in_house_answer": "Yes, in almost all cases, you can remain comfortably in your home during the roof replacement. We understand it's a significant project, and our team prioritizes minimizing disruption to your daily routine. We take care to protect your property and clean up thoroughly. We're happy to discuss any specific concerns or requests you may have.",
